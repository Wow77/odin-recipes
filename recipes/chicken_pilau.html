    <ul>
        <li>1/2 kg chicken</li>
        <li>3-4 kg medium-sized onions</li>
        <li>1/2 tablespoon of fresh ginger</li>
        <li>2 cups of water</li>
        <li>4 cups of water</li>
        <li>5 small potatoes</li>
        <li>Fresh ground cinnamon</li>
        <li>Fresh ground cardamom</li>
        <li>Fresh ground cumin</li>
        <li>Bay leaves</li>
        <li>Salt</li>
        <li>5 tablespoons of vegetable oil</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons fo pilau masala mix</li>
    </ul>
    <h4>Steps</h4>
    <ol>
        <li>Start by frying the chopped onions in the vegetable oil until the onions are soft and almost browned.</li>
        <li>Add in the ginger and garlic paste and let this cook for 2 minutes until they're fragrant.</li>
        <li>Add cinnamon, cardamon and cumin right after ginger and garlic.</li>
        <li>Add the chicken, season generously with salt, and cover.</li>
        <li>Allow the meat to cook until it dries up. The meat will let out its own juices and cook in them, and it will<br>
            eventually dry out and begin to brown.</li>
        <li>Once the meat browns and caramelizes, add in the potatoes. Mix them together and let the postatoes sip in the<br>
            oil and onion mix for a minute.
        </li>
        <li>After, add in the 3 tablespoons of pilau masala mix and bay leaves.</li>
        <li>Let the spices toast for a minute to let them bring out their best flavors.</li>
        <li>Add in the washed rice and stir the rice into the spices until the rice gets mixed into the spices.</li>
        <li>Finally, add in the 4 cups of water and let this begin to boil while stirring to make sure everything is well mixed</li>
        <li>Once it begins boiling, cover the sufuria with foil tightly and reduce the heat to the lowest heat.</li>
        <li>The rice will simmer on low heat for about 15-20 minutes until it dries out.</li>
        <li>Once the rice is dry, remove the foil and fluff the rice using a fork. Remove and discard the bay leaves.</li>
        <li>Use the fork to mix up the rice with any of the beef and onions that might have floated and settled at the top.</li>
        <li>Serve hot with some fresh kachumbari(salsa) and of course, a banana to go along with the spicy rice.</li>
    </ol>
